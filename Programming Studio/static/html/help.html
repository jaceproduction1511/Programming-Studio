		<h2>Welcome, Adventurer!</h2>
		
		<p>The world you are about to explore contains mystery, danger, and rich rewards
		for those who can successfully navigate it's labyrinth. This page will serve 
		as your guide to avoid the multitude of perils that await you. </p>
		
		<p>You are about to enter the lair of the <i><b>Wumpus<sup class = "tm">TM</sup></b></i>. 
		This foul smelling beast has hidden a great treasure of <i>shiny, klinky, gold</i> 
		somewhere in the cave. You are tasked with the objective of delving into this 
		dangerous Lair, collecting the gold, and reaching the Exit Door with your 
		prize. <i>Alive</i></p>
		
		<h2>This is you:</h2>
		
		<p><img class="player" src="/static/interface_elements/universal/player_sprite.png"><br>
		At the beginning of the match you will be placed at a random location in the 
		Wumpus's lair. The Lair consists of many tiles, or rooms arranged into a 
		rectangular grid. </p>
		
		<h2>The map:</h2>
		
		<p><img class="map_snippet" src="/static/interface_elements/help/map_snippet.png"><br>
		At most locations on the map, you may move to the position above, below, left, 
		or right of you as long as that move wouldn't take you off of the map. </p>
		
		<p>Additionally, there is a <i>"Fog of War"</i> covering the map, meaning that (in most 
		cases) a tile/room must be visited before its contents are revealed and 
		displayed on the map.</p>
		
		<h2>The environment possesses several important features that you should be aware of:</h2>
		
		<p><ul>
			<li><b>Pits:</b><img src="/static/interface_elements/universal/pit_sprite.png"><br>
			Some rooms have had great sinkholes open up underneath them. Entering a room containing 
			one of these pits causes you to slip and fall down to your death.<br> <u>You will feel a 
			Cool Breeze (<img src="/static/interface_elements/help/breeze.png">) if you are in a
			tile/room that is adjacent to a pit.</u></li>
			
			<li><b>Wumpus:</b><img src="/static/interface_elements/universal/wumpus_sprite.png"><br>A 
			horrible smelly monster that occupies this Lair. The Wumpus is absolutely lethal and will 
			immediately eat anyone unfortunate enough to occupy the same room. <br><u>You will smell a 
			Horrible Stench (<img src="/static/interface_elements/help/smell.png">) if you are in 
			a tile/room that is adjacent to a Wumpus.</u></li>
				<ul>
					<li> The Wumpus can be killed using an Arrow (Arrow usage is described 
					later in this help screen)</li>
					
					<li><u>Additionally, when a Wumpus is killed, all Players will hear a blood curdling 
					noise resonate throughout the Chamber</u></li>
				</ul>
			
			<li><b>Gold:</b><img src="/static/interface_elements/universal/gold_sprite.png"><br>The great 
			treasure, hoarded by the Wumpus. It is hidden away in one of the rooms somewhere in the Lair.<br><u>
			You will see the Glitter of Gold (<img src="/static/interface_elements/help/glitter.png">) if 
			you are in the same tile/room with the gold.</u></li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<!-- Movement -->
		<div><img class="movement" src="/static/interface_elements/help/movement.png"></div>
		<div class="section"><br>
		
		<p>Movement in this game works in a turn based manner. You can select a direction to move in the 
		next turn by clicking on the arrows next to your player character. <u>When both players have selected 
		a move, the turn will execute.</u></p>
		</div>
		
		<!-- Items -->
		<div><img class="items" src="/static/interface_elements/help/items.png"></div>
		<div class="section"><br>
		
		<p>There are numerous items that can be found on the map and each is used for a 
		different purpose. Items are placed around the map randomly at the beginning of 
		the game and, additionally, may be spawned via random events in all difficulty 
		levels.</p>
		
		<p><img class="gold" src="/static/interface_elements/universal/gold_sprite.png"><br><b>Gold:</b> 
		This is Gold. The prize! <u>Your Gold will be dropped on the ground in a random loaction if you die while 
		possessing it.</u></p>
		
		<p><img class="life_potion" src="/static/interface_elements/universal/life_potion_sprite.png"><br> 
		<b>Life Potion:</b>This rare item will grant you an extra life! It is definitely 
		your lucky day if you find one!</p>
		
		<p><img class="ability_potion" src="/static/interface_elements/universal/ability_potion_sprite.png"><br> 
		<b>Ability Potion:</b>This item grants an extra use of your ability (this only 
		applies to the Scout, adding an extra usage of his reveal ability.)</p>
		
		<p><img class="arrow" src="/static/interface_elements/universal/arrow_sprite.png"><br><b>Arrow:</b> 
		An Arrow! (Arrows are explained more fully in the following section)</p>
		
		<!---<p><img class="item_selection" src="/static/interface_elements/help/item_selection.png"><br> -->
		<p>Items can be picked up by clicking on the square you are currently occupying. you will then pick up 
		everything in that tile. </p>
		
		</div>
		
		<!-- Arrows -->
		<div><img class="arrows" src="/static/interface_elements/help/arrows.png"></div>
		<div class="section"><br>
		
		<p>Most class types are given 1 arrow at the beginning of the match. (With the 
		notable exception of the Hunter class, who is given 2)</p>
		
		<p><img class="arrow_selection" src="/static/interface_elements/help/arrow_selection.png"></p>
		
		<p>Using an arrow works similarly to movement. A notable difference being that <u>
		arrows are fired instantaneously</u> rather than after the turn executes.</p>
		<p>Arrows will travel until they kill something or encounter the edge of the map. 
		If an arrow encouters the edge of the map It will drop onto the ground at that 
		location and can be picked up like any other item.</p>
		
		</div>
		
		<!-- Game Modes -->
		<div><img class="game_modes" src="/static/interface_elements/help/game_modes.png"></div>
		<div class="section"><br>
		
		<h2>There are two game modes to choose from:</h2>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<b>Competitive/Player vs Player:</b>

					first to retrieve the gold and return it to the Exit Door or defeat 
					eachother in ranged combat.</li>

					return it to the Exit Door. If one Player completes the goal, the entire 
					Team wins. If all players lose all of their lives, the Team loses.</li>
					
					<li>The "Fog of War" is slightly different in this mode. All revealed 
					tiles revealed by any player, anywhere on the map, are made visible 
					to <i>all</i> other players on the Team.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		</p>
